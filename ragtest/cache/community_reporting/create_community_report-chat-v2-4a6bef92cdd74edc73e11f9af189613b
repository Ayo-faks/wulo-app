This change is evidenced by Scrooge's decision to raise Bob Cratchit's salary and assist his struggling family, marking a significant positive shift in their employer-employee relationship. Additionally, Scrooge decides to send a large turkey to the Cratchit family as a Christmas gift, further demonstrating his newfound generosity and care for Bob and his family.
